# Odin Photo Widget

This very basic app is a photo viewer that interfaces with the Flickr API to find the photos of a given user. This learning project was created as a part of the curriculum at [The Odin Project](theodinproject.com). Project specs can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-flickr-api). 

Because this project is merely an opportunity to gain experience working with external APIs, there are no plans further functionality at this time
